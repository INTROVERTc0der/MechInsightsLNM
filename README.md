# MechInsights LNM

**MechInsights LNM** is a web application developed for the Mechanical Department of LNMIIT, Jaipur. It automates the process of calculating Program Outcome (PO) and Program Specific Outcome (PSO) attainments using an indirect method based on feedback forms from students.

## Overview

Every educational institution needs to evaluate PO and PSO attainments to assess how well the curriculum aligns with its educational goals. Traditionally, this process is done manually, where feedback forms are distributed to students, and data is collected and processed through Google Sheets. This manual process is time-consuming and error-prone.

**MechInsights LNM** solves this problem by automating the entire workflow, allowing faculties to:

- Distribute feedback forms to students.
- Track form completion rates.
- Automatically calculate PO and PSO attainments based on the feedback results.

The application simplifies the calculation process by allowing HODs to calculate attainments with just a click, based on both direct (exam results) and indirect (feedback) methods.
